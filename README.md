# Books Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of books to extract meaningful insights and visualizations using Power BI.

## Project Overview

The analysis aims to:
- Explore key patterns and trends within the book dataset.
- Visualize data to understand factors like genre popularity, author productivity, and publication trends.
- Generate insights into the book market, such as average ratings, publication distribution, and author success metrics.

## Dataset

- **Dataset File**: `books.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains information on books, including details like title, author, genre, ratings, publication year, and other features.
  
> **Note**: Due to its large size (over 50 MB), the `books.csv` file is managed using Git Large File Storage (LFS).

## Analysis

The analysis was performed using Power BI, and the project file is available as `Books_dataset_analysis.pbix`. Key visualizations include:

- **Genre Distribution**: Analyzes the distribution of books across various genres.
- **Top Authors**: Displays the most productive and highest-rated authors.
- **Publication Trends**: Shows the trend in book publications over time.
- **Average Ratings by Genre**: Visualizes average ratings for different genres.
- **Top-Rated Books**: Highlights the books with the highest ratings.

## Requirements

- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for handling the large dataset file.
- Power BI to open and interact with the `.pbix` file.
